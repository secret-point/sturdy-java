/**
 * A functional interface for <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>-structured data.
 *
 * <p>A graph is composed of a set of nodes and a set of edges connecting pairs of nodes.
 *
 * <p>There are three main interfaces provided to represent graphs. In order of increasing
 * complexity they are: {@link Graph}, {@link ValueGraph}, and {@link Network}. You should generally
 * prefer the simplest interface that satisfies your use case. See the <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#choosing-the-right-graph-type">
 * "Choosing the right graph type"</a> section of the Guava User Guide for more details.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Some graph algorithms only care about the nodes that are adjacent to a node but not about other
 * properties such as the size or type of edges (e.g. depth first search). These algorithms should
 * prefer working with {@code SuccessorsFunction} rather than a more specialized type.
 *
 * <p>When calling a method that requires a {@code SuccessorsFunction}, you can use {@link Graph},
 * {@link ValueGraph}, {@link Network} or implement this interface for an already existing data
 * structure.
 *
 * <h3>Additional documentation</h3>
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide for the {@code common.graph} package (<a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained">"Graphs Explained"</a>) for
 * additional documentation, including <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#notes-for-implementors">notes for
 * implementors</a>
