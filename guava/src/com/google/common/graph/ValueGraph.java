/**
 * An interface to represent a graph data structure. Graphs can be either directed or undirected
 * (but cannot have both directed edges and undirected edges). Every edge is associated with an
 * arbitrary user-provided value. Parallel edges are not supported (although the Value type may be,
 * for example, a collection).
 *
 * <p>Nodes in a graph are analogous to keys in a Map - they must be unique within a graph.
 * Values in a graph are analogous to values in a Map - they may be any arbitrary object.
 *
 * TODO(b/30133524): Rewrite the top-level javadoc from scratch.
 *
 * TODO(jasexton): Rename interface (and various other classes) to "Graph".
