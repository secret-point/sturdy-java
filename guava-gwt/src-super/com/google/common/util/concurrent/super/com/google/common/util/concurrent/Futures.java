  // A note on memory visibility.
  // Many of the utilities in this class (transform, withFallback, withTimeout, asList, combine)
  // have two requirements that significantly complicate their design.
  // 1. Cancellation should propagate from the returned future to the input future(s).
  // 2. The returned futures shouldn't unnecessarily 'pin' their inputs after completion.
  //
  // A consequence of these requirements is that the delegate futures cannot be stored in
  // final fields.
  //
  // For simplicity the rest of this description will discuss Futures.catching since it is the
  // simplest instance, though very similar descriptions apply to many other classes in this file.
  //
  // In the constructor of AbstractCatchingFuture, the delegate future is assigned to a field
  // 'inputFuture'. That field is non-final and non-volatile.  There are 2 places where the
  // 'inputFuture' field is read and where we will have to consider visibility of the write
  // operation in the constructor.
  //
  // 1. In the listener that performs the callback.  In this case it is fine since inputFuture is
  //    assigned prior to calling addListener, and addListener happens-before any invocation of the
  //    listener. Notably, this means that 'volatile' is unnecessary to make 'inputFuture' visible
  //    to the listener.
  //
  // 2. In done() where we may propagate cancellation to the input.  In this case it is _not_ fine.
  //    There is currently nothing that enforces that the write to inputFuture in the constructor is
  //    visible to done().  This is because there is no happens before edge between the write and a
  //    (hypothetical) unsafe read by our caller. Note: adding 'volatile' does not fix this issue,
  //    it would just add an edge such that if done() observed non-null, then it would also
  //    definitely observe all earlier writes, but we still have no guarantee that done() would see
  //    the inital write (just stronger guarantees if it does).
  //
  // See: http://cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2015-January/013800.html
  // For a (long) discussion about this specific issue and the general futility of life.
  //
  // For the time being we are OK with the problem discussed above since it requires a caller to
  // introduce a very specific kind of data-race.  And given the other operations performed by these
  // methods that involve volatile read/write operations, in practice there is no issue.  Also, the
  // way in such a visibility issue would surface is most likely as a failure of cancel() to
  // propagate to the input.  Cancellation propagation is fundamentally racy so this is fine.
  //
  // Future versions of the JMM may revise safe construction semantics in such a way that we can
  // safely publish these objects and we won't need this whole discussion.
  // TODO(user,lukes): consider adding volatile to all these fields since in current known JVMs
  // that should resolve the issue.  This comes at the cost of adding more write barriers to the
  // implementations.
